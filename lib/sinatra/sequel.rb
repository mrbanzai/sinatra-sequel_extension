# Sinatra::SequelExtension was forked from (rtomayko's sinatra-sequel gem)[https://github.com/rtomayko/sinatra-sequel],
# which has not had any commits since 2013. Install this gem using 
# +sudo gem install sinatra-sequel_extension+ or (if using RVM) 
# +gem install sinatra-sequel_extension+. rtomayko's gem can be installed
# with +sudo gem install sinatra-sequel+. The following information pertains to

# This gem extends the Sinatra DSL to work with the Sequel ORM gem. Install
# the Sinatra and Sequel gems using +sudo gem install sinatra sequel+, or 
# +gem install sinatra sequel+ if using RVM. Alternatively, add the following
# to your app's Gemfile[http://bundler.io]:
#     gem 'sinatra'
#     gem 'sequel'
#     gem 'sequel-sinatra_extension', '>= 0.9'
# Install the gems using +bundle install+.
#
# Sinatra::SequelExtension can work with MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite3 adapters,
# as well as a number of others[https://github.com/jeremyevans/sequel/tree/master/lib/sequel/adapters].

    # * The database URL is set to be the SQLite database (+*.db+) whose name corresponds to
    #   the current Rack environment, which is presumed to be stored in the app's root
    #   directory, for example, +./development.db+. This behavior can be overwritten by
    #   setting the environment variable +DATABASE_URL+.
    # * The name of the migrations table is set to +migrations+.
    # * The migrations log is directed to +STDOUT+.
    # * The +SequelHelper+ module is added to the app's helpers.
    # 
    # This method will be called automatically when you +require+ the Sinatra::SequelExtension
    # module in your main app file; it should not be called explicitly.
    #
    # If there is a problem registering the extension,please (file an issue report)[https://github.com/danascheider/sinatra-sequel_extension/issues]
    # or make a pull request.
